 Thats why the dates of Hindu festivals  like Diwali, Rakhi, Holi change every year. <br/>
 But Makar Sankranti is a festival which falls on the same day every year as it follows the solar calender. <br/>
 However, once every eighty years, due to revolution, the day is postponed by one day. Thats why Makarsankranti is on Jan 15 this year. <br/>
 Generally Makar Sankranti is celebrated on the 14th of January every year (sometimes on the 15th) for now. From 2050, it is predicted that the festival will fall on the 15th January (and occasionally on the 16th). <br/>
 <br/>
 Before year 2000, internet was not available to everyone and the information about festival was not widely available.  So Makarsankranti was celebrated mostly on Ja 14th. <br/>
 Now the information & facts are  available to everyone and it is celebrated on jan 14 or Jan 15.</font></span>

 On this day, the sun is believed to leave its southernmost position and begin its northward journey. Maghe Sankranti is similar to solstice festivals in other religious traditions.<br/>

Hindus take ritual baths during this festival,  at auspicious river locations. These include Sankhamul on the Bagmati near Patan; In the Gandaki/Narayani river basin at Triveni near the Indian border, Devghat near Chitwan Valley and Ridi on the Kaligandaki; and in the Koshi River basin at Dolalghat on the Sun Koshi. Festive foods like laddoo, ghee and sweet potatoes are distributed. The mother of each household wishes good health to all family members.
<br/>
As per Kirat community Maghe Sankranti denotes start of a new year which is called Yele Dhung. Based on the rical evidence Kirat calendar was started when King Yalamber conquered Kathmandu valley.<br/>
